# About Me

My name is Walter Arenas, I am a full-stack software engineer that uses JavaScript, React and Python to develop applications that talk to relational and non-relational databases.  

Until recently, I performed as a successful international sales director working with airports. CoVid took good care of that business and provided me with the wonderful opportunity to pivot into a career that I always dreamed of. What diferentiates me from similar candidates is that I am a proven, driven, seasoned professional that will bring instant dedication and discipline to the job at hand with a unique and fresh perspective of what the end user needs. My additional background in project management, paired with my education as an electrical engineer, provides me me with a unique perspective in problem-solving and customer satisfaction, whether that customer is my employer or an end user.

I look forward to becoming part of your success!

-Walter
