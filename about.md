# About Me

My name is Walter Arenas, I am a full-stack software engineer that uses JavaScript, React and Python to develop applications that talk to SQL and non-relational databases.  My strong  background in sales and project management, paired with my education as an electrical engineer have provided me with a unique perspective in problem-solving and customer satisfaction, which allows me to provide the end user with a pleasant and rewarding experience.

I am a Peruvian native, bilingual (English/Spanish) with intermediate Portuguese and Italian. My extensive international experience has allowed me to travel the world for over 15 years. This involvement has taught me the importance of considering cultural differences to achieve success in international business.
